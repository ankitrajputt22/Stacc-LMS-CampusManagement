# Stacc Repository Instructions

- Stacc uses MySQL. Treat older references to PostgreSQL as outdated unless a current phase explicitly changes this decision.
- Use a modular-monolith architecture with clear domain boundaries.
- The frontend uses React and TypeScript; the backend uses Java and Spring Boot.
- Work only on the currently requested development phase. Do not implement future features early.
- Inspect the repository before editing and preserve existing working functionality.
- Do not refactor unrelated code without a clear phase-related reason.
- Never hard-code credentials or secrets. Use environment configuration instead.
- Enforce permissions on the backend; frontend visibility is not a security boundary.
- Keep frontend and backend API contracts consistent.
- Use Canvas LMS as a UX reference without copying its branding, assets, or exact design.
- Maintain a coherent Stacc identity across the UI. Google Stitch may provide approved design references.
- Keep commit messages simple and human-readable.
